# flight-sim
Library for 6 Degree-of-Freedom simulation of aerospace vehicles

## Objectives of the project
I want to develop a generic flight simulation library using Python 3. The main objectives of the project are as follows:
* Develop a simulator with multibody and multi-vehicle simulation capability
* It will be used for vehicle design, development, and testing of flight control algorithms
* The project will have a good technical documentation about the software architecture and mathematical models.
* The environmental effects (especially wind) will be realistically modeled.
* There will be realistic actuator and sensor models (I want to say high fidelity but I don't know if I will be able to verify the models).
* It will be possible visualize the flight using existing tools such as Google Earth, [ayvri](https://ayvri.com), [dashware](http://www.dashware.net/), [airdata](https://airdata.com) , etc.

## Why I am working on this?
I have experience with Matlab - Simulink environment for simulation and real-time programming (see my [thesis work](https://github.com/alpmarangoz/thesis-work)). I want to work on an autonomous vehicle as a side-project and ofcourse it is not feasible to use Simulink for non-commercial projects. I looked into [AirSim](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim) but it is more specific to computer vision applications. Therefore, I decided to develop my own project. I also wanted to check if Python is good for the job and to document my technical knowledge for archival purposes.

I know that there is a big world out there that I can not just scan with few keyword searches. Please send me a message if you know a good reference, library or tools that I can use or have some ideas to share.
