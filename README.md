# flight-sim
Library for 6 Degree-of-Freedom simulation of aerospace vehicles

## Aim
I want to develop a generic flight simulation library using Python 3. The main objectives of the project are as follows:
* Develop a simulator with multibody and multi vehicle simulation capability
* It will be used for vehicle design, development, and testing of flight control algorithms
* The project will have a good technical documentation about the software architecture and mathematical models.
* The environmental effects (especially wind) will be realistaclly modeled.
* It will be possible visualize the flight using existing tools such as Google Earth, ayvri, 3D log viewer, VFXON ZOOMED etc.
